# The Ray Tracer Challenge

This is a project based on the book `The Ray Tracer Challenge` by Jamis Buck.

In this project I intend to learn Rust, which I have no real knowledge of from earlier. In addition I will also try to exclusively use Vim motions for all my editing in a hope of getting more comfortable with that as well.

## Progress

- Chapter 1 completed
- Chapter 2 started

## Todo list

- Revisit Chapter 1 to restructure the tuples, points, and vectors.  
  These are currently uncomfortably intertwined and prevent usage of things like tuples in other modules, such as the colors introduced in chapter 2.
