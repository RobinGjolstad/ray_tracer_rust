# The Ray Tracer Challenge

This is a project based on the book `The Ray Tracer Challenge` by Jamis Buck.

In this project I intend to learn Rust, which I have no real knowledge of from earlier. In addition I will also try to exclusively use Vim motions for all my editing in a hope of getting more comfortable with that as well.

## Progress

- Chapter 1 completed
- Chapter 2 completed
- Chapter 3 completed
- Chapter 4 completed
- Chapter 5 completed
- Chapter 6 completed
- Chapter 7 completed
- Chapter 8 completed
- Chapter 9 completed
- Chapter 10 started

## Todo list

- Add support for a different image file format. An external crate should be used for this.
- Add support for text-based world definitions. Will make it easier to have a single "main" with just different config files. Will also make it easier to share a world with someone else.
- Implement multithreading. Should be done early to avoid major re-writes if things are implemented in a way which is incompatible with multithreading.

## Ambitious expansions

After the ray tracer is implemented I intend to create a GUI for easier configuration of the world and "live" rendering.
