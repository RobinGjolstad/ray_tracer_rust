# The Ray Tracer Challenge

This is a project based on the book `The Ray Tracer Challenge` by Jamis Buck.

In this project I intend to learn Rust, which I have no real knowledge of from earlier. 
In addition I will also try to exclusively use Vim motions for all my editing in a hope of getting more comfortable with that as well.

## Ambitious expansions

After the ray tracer is implemented I intend to create a GUI for easier configuration of the world and "live" rendering.
